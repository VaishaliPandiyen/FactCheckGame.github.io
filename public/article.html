            <h1>TBD: TO BE DECIDED</h1>
            <p>A social media post’s (real one, not a parody or satire) main “fact” will be surrounded by additional
                information – in the post, comments, and other posts or the news/blog article.
            </p>
            <p>The “additional” information’s source credibility and arguments make you believe the post (or not).
            </p>
            <p>But, wait! Most of us process all that information real quick, as we have other posts to keep scrolling.
            </p>
            <p>TBD (To Be Decided) wants you to pause, see if the supporting facts add up to the statement – which at
                this
                point, we call it claim.</p>

            <p> When we’re so immersed in consuming content, critical thinking often takes a
                back seat. You’ll be surprised how easy it is to assume X means Y!</p>

                <p>You'll see a statement (claim). </p>
                <p>Check if the additional info (clues) add up to it and evaluate
                    whether the claim is true or false.</p>
                <p> Sometimes, the clues would be missing context or half-truths (just as you would find it in rality),
                    but the claims are simple true/false.
                </p>
                <p>The game aims to make you pause and think whether the clue(s) support the claim, as you have a
                    decision to make. </p>

                <p>TBD is mainly for the young minds — ages 11 and up. </p>

                <p> The claims and clues used have been taken from existing PolitiFact fact checks and articles. </p>

                    engaging and edutaining way. TBD is now an idea prototype for gamifying media literacy, with a focus
                    on critical thinking about why players believe something is true or false.</i>
                <h3>Misinformation in plain sight</h3>
                <p>Social media runs on user engagement, and so, its users tend to <a
                        href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2216614120\">prioritise</a> sharing content that
                    engages others before thinking of verifying its accuracy. This tendency for impulsive content can
                    lead to a spread of misinformation because people are <a
                        href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03344-2\">distracted</a> from assessing its accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>The sheer abundance of information can often <a
                        href="https://www.journals.eagora.org/revVISUAL/article/view/4592">simplify news processing</a>
                    as we skim content. This diminishes our ability and the time we can spend to detect misinformation,
                    leading to developing a blind trust in credible media sources.</p>
                <p>Social media also makes us <a
                        href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210226-the-darkly-soothing-compulsion-of-doomscrolling">doom-scroll</a>,
                    and is a place where we spend a lot of time reading negative news stories. Researches show that this
                    activity can <a href="https://www.ijnrnursing.com/index.php/journal/article/view/246">diminish our
                        attentiveness</a>, and our <a
                        href="https://www.pamelarutledge.com/the-brain-is-hardwired-to-doomscroll-can-you-stop-it/">cognitive
                        biases</a> make us focus more on negative information during uncertainty. This can fuel anxiety
                    and a compulsive urge to stay informed, which can then further aggravate the spread of distressing
                    and emotionally charged misinformation.</p>
                <p>When social media users don’t critically think about what they consume as they’re deeply immersed in the content, it can <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/attention-spans">lead</a> to low efficiency and high errors. There are many media literacy initiatives that pass on the responsibility of not taking in misleading content to individuals. This raises questions about the role of media and journalists, as the rise of “non-professional” journalism on social media is observed to complicate things further when fake news can be seen as “<a href="https://davidbuckingham.net/2017/01/12/fake-news-is-media-literacy-the-answer/">profitable</a>”. While media organisations and platforms must play a proactive role in ensuring content accuracy and integrity, promoting critical thinking and information verification can help mitigate misinformation, on the other hand.</p>
