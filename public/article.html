            <h1>TBD: TO BE DECIDED</h1>
            <p>A social media post’s (real one, not a parody or satire) main “fact” will be surrounded by additional
                information – in the post, comments, and other posts or the news/blog article.
            </p>
            <p>The “additional” information’s source credibility and arguments make you believe the post (or not).
            </p>
            <p>But, wait! Most of us process all that information real quick, as we have other posts to keep scrolling towards.
            </p>
            <p>TBD (To Be Decided) wants you to pause, see if the supporting facts add up to the statement – which at
                this
                point, we call it a claim.</p>

            <p> When we’re so immersed in consuming content, critical thinking often takes a
                back seat. You’ll be surprised how easy it is to assume X means Y!</p>

                    whether the claim is true or false.</p>
                <p> Sometimes, the clues would be missing context or half-truths (just as you would find it in reality),

                    encourage people, mainly young minds, to question what they see and logically deduce its veracity
                    through this project, which aims to take media literacy to educators (schools and digital) in an
                    engaging and edutaining way. TBD is now an idea prototype for gamifying media literacy, with a focus

                <h3>Misinformation in plain sight</h3>
                <p>Social media runs on user engagement, and so its users tend to <a
                        href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2216614120\">prioritise</a> sharing content that
                    engages others before thinking of verifying its accuracy. This tendency for impulsive content can
                    lead to the spread of misinformation because people are <a
                        href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03344-2\">distracted</a> from assessing its accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>The sheer abundance of information can often <a
                        href="https://www.journals.eagora.org/revVISUAL/article/view/4592">simplify news processing</a>
                    as we skim content. This diminishes our ability and the time we can spend to detect misinformation,
                    leading to a blind trust in credible media sources.</p>
                <p>Social media also makes us <a
                        href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20210226-the-darkly-soothing-compulsion-of-doomscrolling">doom-scroll</a>
                    and is a place where we spend a lot of time reading negative news stories. Researche shows that this
                    activity can <a href="https://www.ijnrnursing.com/index.php/journal/article/view/246">diminish our
                        attentiveness</a>, and our <a
                        href="https://www.pamelarutledge.com/the-brain-is-hardwired-to-doomscroll-can-you-stop-it/">cognitive
                        biases</a> make us focus more on negative information during uncertainty. This can fuel anxiety
                    and a compulsive urge to stay informed, which can then further aggravate the spread of distressing
                    and emotionally charged misinformation.</p>
                <p>When social media users don’t critically think about what they consume because they’re deeply
                    immersed in the content, it can <a
                        href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/attention-spans">lead</a> to low
                    efficiency and high errors. There are many media literacy initiatives that pass on the
                    responsibility of not taking in misleading content to individuals. This raises questions about the
                    role of media and journalists, as the rise of “non-professional” journalism on social media is
                    observed to complicate things further when fake news can be seen as “<a
                        href="https://davidbuckingham.net/2017/01/12/fake-news-is-media-literacy-the-answer/">profitable</a>”.
                    While media organisations and platforms must play a proactive role in ensuring content accuracy and
                    integrity, promoting critical thinking and information verification can help mitigate
                    misinformation, on the other hand.</p>
                <h3>Media Literacy Gamification</h3>
                <h4>Existing games</h4>
                <p>Factitious saw a short-lived success, thanks to the US <a
                        href="https://medium.com/@bobhone.designer/factitious-news-game-helps-students-spot-fake-news-better-7edad9d8b985">schools'
                        engagement and their interest</a> in integrating it into classroom learning. One of its
                    co-creators Robert Hone, shares his takeaways: “From my limited experience observing students using
                    the Factitious news game as part of media literacy courses (which occurred in 2019, before ChatGPT
                    was released), I’ve noticed several useful tactics: Games that challenge players to correctly
                    identify false and true online stories can help introduce the concept of media literacy in a fun and
                    surprising way. When organising students into groups of competing teams, they debate within their
                    teams as to the veracity of articles, thereby vocalising their thought processes, which aids
                    learning.” </p>
                <p>Fakey focuses on <a
                        href="https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2019/can-media-literacy-be-gamified-a-qa-with-one-of-fakeys-developers/">identifying
                        trustworthy sources</a>, emphasising how it is important to evaluate players' ability to
                    distinguish between true and false information using source identification. The News Literacy
                    Project's (NLP) Senior Director of Media Relations, Christina Veiga, emphasised the importance of
                    media literacy programmes for educating students and educators and good practices for the same.
                    Their game, <a href="https://informable.newslit.org/">Informable</a> targets general audiences and
                    students. The <a href="https://www.getbadnews.com/books/english/">Bad News</a> game shows us how
                    easy it is to become a "fake newsmonger".</p>
                <p>Taking into account these insights, as a part of my master's dissertation, I have prototyped a media
                    literacy game with an emphasis on critical thinking for students.</p>
                <h4>TBD</h4>
                <p>TBD, or "To Be Decided," is a media literacy gamification initiative designed to work on the critical
                    thinking aspect of media literacy, especially among the younger generation, addressing issues of
                    misinformation and impulsive content sharing. It is an effort to reshape the way we consume and
                    evaluate information. </p>
                <p>It encourages critical thinking about the current events we read about and how truthful they seem.
                    TBD's primary motivation is to bring media literacy gamification into education, particularly in
                    schools.</p>

                <h4>Behind TBD</h4>
                <p>As the game’s idea and goals became clear, I required a database of claims and related data. The game involves players looking at supporting information about the claim and deciding whether they validate/invalidate the claim. I had reviewed the few existing fact-checking APIs earlier and noted their shortcomings – they don’t show related misleading and correct links, they don’t have a list of what is true and what is false about a claim, and they don't provide context for the claim.

                    I looked at the True, Good enough to be true and False fact-checks from PolitiFact, taking note of what each claim said, who it was about, its context, the claim’s story and giveaways. After that, I reviewed the clues and information about the claim, sorted them into clues and responses, wherever applicable. When I couldn’t find the responses’ content in the article, I created them based on guides and theories of fact checking from News Literacy Project, Poynter IFCN, etc. I have used only PolitiFact fact-checked claims in this game for its resourceful articles, maintain consistency, and keep it simple for now. Data curation was the game's foundation after the principles and context were established because it provided the framework and character that a prototype was built on.
                    </p>
                <p>Referring back to the project’s review’s observations about people constantly switching their attention and the nature of social media consumption, I designed this game – both design interface and concept flow – based on my understanding that people, especially younger ones,  consume a lot of social media content in short bursts rather than a consistent and continuous narrative.
<br><br>
                    I tried to keep the game simple and straight-forward with a concise and engaging (not cluttered) interface design. I wanted to follow the simplicity of the game’s goal and objectives, and communicate it directly with a simple tone. This helped me prioritise the game’s core objectives, focusing on its usability and functionality, rather than worrying about complex mechanics and flows. It was time efficient too. To visualise the game's flows and content, I created a single-page paper prototype. This made experimentation, iteration, and improvement easier and faster. I then tried this out as a simple HTML-CSS-JS app prototype that pulls data from a JSON file curated from the selected fact checks. 
                    <br><br>
                    The player will first see who the claim is about and the context in which it is set as the claim loads. The claim will be displayed along with a prompt to view clues and sources – how can one decide the claim’s truthfulness without looking at related information? It’s the player’s choice whether they want to investigate any given clues’ (related information) sources if they have hyperlinks, and whether to view more clues. The app will track how many clues they’ve viewed and choose a response based on whether they find a particular claim truthful or not. When they decide and click on the true or false buttons, the game will show a creator-generated response along with the source of the fact check. TBD will also let players know where they possibly could have made a misjudgement based on half-fact clues or irrelevant clues. Even if they get the verdict right after viewing an incomplete clue, the game will prompt an appropriate educational response.<br><br>
                    Considering each piece of information would be no longer than 2 lines or sentences – made that way to retain the player’s attention, deciding whether a claim is true or false wouldn’t take more than a few seconds of viewing the clues – unless the class is having a discussion about it. For this reason, I have not decided whether to track the time taken to evaluate each clue as a backend research record or as an on-screen limit.
                    I hope to test this out if and when the intended audience plays the game and discusses whether they had a smooth interaction with it and whether it was too easy. By simplicity, I mean simple rules and game mechanics, not easily discernible content. 
                    </p>
                <p>The first obstacle I faced was a lack or limited availability of reliable, up-to-date fact-check APIs to use for the game. For this scope of the project, I created my dataset using the published fact-checks. Next was finding research or survey data on media literacy trends, the specific needs of the target audience, and, mainly, how to interpret these numbers. This is a challenge I haven’t dealt with while prototyping the game or writing the article, as it was hard to get an expert view or try to make sense of it in a way that matters. Defining who would play this game and how to reach them was something I had to do before I could get into data collection and creative design. During the course of data collection, I had to understand who is responsible for teaching and promoting media literacy in different settings and tailoring the game accordingly. It was important to answer the question of why anyone would want to play it to make sure the game had enough motivation and engagement.</p>
